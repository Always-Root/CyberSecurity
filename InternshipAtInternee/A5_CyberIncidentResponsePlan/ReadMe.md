# Simulateing a ransomware attack and documenting
Attack demo: https://github.com/Always-Root/Ransomware

## Common symptoms that a ransomware attack has successfully taken place
* File extensions changed: Files will have unusual extensions appended to their names, often reflecting the specific gang, such as .lockbit (for LockBit ransomware) or other random characters, making them unreadable.
* Desktop background changed: Your screen background is frequently replaced with a full-screen image or message from the attackers, serving as the primary ransom note and instruction page.
* Ransom notes appear in folders: Text or HTML files (e.g., READ_ME.txt, HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.html) are strategically dropped into every directory containing encrypted files. These notes explain the situation and provide payment instructions.
* Deletion of Volume Shadow Copies: Attackers often try to delete "shadow copies" and backup files to prevent you from using standard Windows tools to recover your files easily.

## What to do when a ransomware attack going to take place?
* Disconnect your computer from the network immediately: Pull out the Ethernet cable or turn off Wi-Fi to stop the ransomware from spreading to other computers.
* Inform your IT or Security Operations Center (SOC) team right away: Report the issue to the relevant team within your organization so they can begin their incident response process.
* Preserve any ransom notes or suspicious files: Do not delete these items, as they contain critical information (like the ransomware strain ID or attacker contact details) needed for analysis and potential recovery efforts.
* Wait for instructions before rebooting or shutting down: Do not turn off your computer unless instructed by IT professionals. They may need to collect data from the system's memory that will be lost upon rebooting.


## Staff Training
Continuous staff training on the latest cyber threats covering not just ransomware, but phishing and social engineering. Its critical for any organization.
* Security is a shared responsibility: Protecting an organization’s data and systems is a collective effort, not solely the burden of the security team or the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
* Empower employees as the first line of defense: Well-trained employees are often the best defense against attacks.
* Training must be ongoing and relevant: To be effective, training needs to be continuous and updated frequently to reflect new and emerging attack methods, keeping pace with how real-world threats evolve.
* Build a culture of security awareness: Regular training helps foster an organizational culture where employees feel accountable and confident in identifying and reporting suspicious activity immediately.
